Business Problem

New York City is the largest city in the United States and one of the world's largest tourist destinations. 
There are 65 Million Tourists to New York City a year. The heart of the destination in New York City is centered around Times Square and  Broadway. 
This area is known as the theater district. In 2019, 15 million attended a broadway show. There are numerous bars and restaurants in the theater district. 
I want to know what cuisine the restaurants are serving, the number of types of restaurants, and the price point. 

Target Audience:
The target audience of this projects is tourist and entrepenurs. Tourist would want to what food is in the theater district and what is the cheapest. It is no 
lie that broadway is expensive and there are numerous price points. 
Secondly, if you wanted to open a resturant an entrepenur would want to conduct matrket research and see what the resturants are in the district, what cusines there are serving,
and the price point.
