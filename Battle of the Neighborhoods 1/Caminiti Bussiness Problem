Business Problem

New York City is the largest city in the United States and one of the world's largest tourist destinations. 
There are 65 Million Tourists to New York City a year. The heart of the destination in New York City is centered around Times Square and  Broadway. 
This area is known as the theater district. In 2019, 15 million attended a broadway show. There are numerous bars and restaurants in the theater district. 
I want to know what cuisine the restaurants are serving, the number of types of restaurants, and the price point. 

Questions
1)	How many restaurants are in the theater district?
2)	Where are they located
3)	What cuisine are they serving?
4)	How expensive are the restaurants?
